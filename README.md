# Rubicon – Cross the Language Barrier

![rubicondemo](https://github.com/LinaLtu/final-project/blob/master/rubicondemo.gif)

In 2018, I successfully completed a 12-week-long Full Stack JavaScript Web Development coding bootcamp at SPICED Academy, Berlin. At the end of the course, we had a week to build a project, which we presented on our graduation day. 

*Important: the following code contains only features that were created during the final week. Major features are lacking and the project is still to be completed.*

Since one of my biggest passions, besides coding, is learning foreign languages, when the time came to pick a topic for my final project, it was a simple choice…

Rubicon is a social network where people learning a foreign language can find language exchange partners.

###  Users can:

- register and log in (passwords are hashed and salted),
- upload a picture and edit their profile information,
- search language exchange partners based on their city and native language,
- add users to “starred” (a.k.a. bookmarked) list,
- get suggestions of people who speak their target language,
- send private messages, view messages they have sent and received and/or delete them.

### Technologies used:

- ReactJS and Redux
- Node.js and Express.js
-  PostgreSQL Database
- AWS S3 for Image Storage

Working on this project allowed me to gain more ReactJS experience, helped me underatand data flow between the client and  the server and demonstrated the usefulness and convenience of using Redux.
